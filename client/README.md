**Link to project:** coming soon!

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express

Reading Time is a CRUD app based in full-stack JavaScript/MERN stack. The front-end is handled with React, and the back-end is handled with Node.js/Express. 

## Optimizations

Using the OpenLibrary search API has plenty of quirks, including low-quality search results and lots of duplicates. I am working to improve search results by adding appropriate filters (No "Summary of" books, No books with a multitude of Authors) to the default search.
